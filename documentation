How to Use
There are 2 Software components.

1. rust-tooling-api: This is a rest backend api services that exposes rest endpoint for you to view logs or consume logs on a frontend application.
2. rust-log-collector: This is used for reading logs in form of files. so if u have a service that writes logs to a files. You can specify the name of the service and the path were the logs are written in the config.json

Steps to using it.

1. Ensure you configure the user and password to database in .env
2. Run cargo run -p rust-tooling-api to start the api
3. view this http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui/ to access the swagger for api service
4. register the service that you would like to track the logs.
5. Open the rust-log-collector, add a config just like I pasted below

{
"application_name":"microservice name",
"log_location":"C://Users//GIDI//web3projects//web3-identityserver//microservice_log_location"
}

Add this to the list. Ensure you specify the exact name used when onboarding the service.

//Run this command
cargo run -p rust-log-collector

You woudl see the console tool pulling the logs on the screen.

View the logs for the service you just entered. Ensure that the service has logs in the specified folder path.

http://localhost:5000/api/logs/{serviceid}

replace {serviceid} with the id that was returned to you when you registered the service.

Then you would be able to view the logs been pulled from db
